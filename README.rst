AIMES Execution Manager
=======================

The AIMES execution manager is part of the AIMES middleware. This module implements an execution strategy for a given workload of arbitrary size and duration.

Pilots are managed via `RADICAL-Pilot <http://radical-cybertools.github.io/radical-pilot/>`_ and are instatiated on a set of traget resources described via `bundles <https://github.com/Francis-Liu/aimes.bundle>`_.
